<h3>Problem Name : Balancing Symbols</h3>
<h3>Time Limit : 2s</h3>

<p>Many compilers spill out a hundred lines of errors when a symbol is missed in our codes.To avoid this we write a tool that removes all symbols from the code,except parenthesis,brackets and braces and then checks if they are balanced.Your task is to write a program that checks if a given sequence of symbols is balanced or not.For instance [()] is legal but [(]) is wrong.

<h3>Input:</h3>
<p>
Number of test cases t &le 250 on the first line.Each test consists of the sequence which is a string of characters without spaces (length &le 100).The string will contain only the characters '(' , ')' , '{' , '}' , '[' , ']' .

<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>
For each test output "RIGHT" if the sequence of symbols is matched else "WRONG" on a single line.

<h3>Sample Input:</h3>

[()]

([{

<h3>Sample Output:</h3>
