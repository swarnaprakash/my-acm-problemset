<h3>Problem Name : Cuboids</h3>
<h3>Time Limit : 1s</h3>

<p>
  	A cuboid is a rectangular solid. Given two cuboids, which may or may not overlap, you have to find out the total volume enclosed by them. A volume is considered enclosed if it falls completely within at least one of the specified cuboids. A volume that is in between two cuboids, but not inside both of them, is not considered enclosed.

<h3>Input:</h3>	
<p>
Number of test cases t &le 50 on the first line.Each test consists of two lines describing the two cuboids.Description of a cuboid consists of six space separated integers x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2. (x1,y1,z1) represents the left-bottom-back vertex and (x2,y2,z2) the right-top-front vertex, assuming that x-coordinate increases from left to right ,y-coordinate increases from bottom to top ,z-coordinate increases from back to front.The cuboids are always aligned with the grid. In other words, the cuboids are never tilted or twisted with respect to the axes.
<p>
It is guarenteed that x1 &lt x2 ,y1 &lt y2 ,z1 &lt z2. Absolute value of all co-ordinates is &le 5000.

<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>
Output one line per test containing the total enclosed volume.
