<h3 align="center">Problem Name		:	Making N</h3><h3 align="center">Time Limit		:	5s</h3><p>Consider the following mathematical puzzle<p><b>Making 25:</b><p>Using only the numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6, together with the operations +, -, ×, and ÷, and unlimited use of brackets, make the number 25.  Each number must be used precisely once.  Each operation may be used zero or more times.<p>one way to make 25 is:  4 × (6 + 1) - 3.<p>For this problem we consider a variant of this puzzle, which we call <b>Making N</b>.You have to make N using only the digit 1 (No other digits are allowed!).You can insert any number of brackets anywhere.You can use the following operations<p>ADDITION(a + b) ,example (1+1) +1 =3<br>MULTIPLICATION(a * b) ,example (1+1)*(1+1+1)=6<br>SQUARE(a^2) ,example square(1+1+1) = 9<br>CUBE(a^3) ,example cube(1+1) =8<br>FACTORIAL(a!) ,example fact(1+1+1)=6<br> <p>There might be more than one solution and we are interested in the solution that uses the minimum number of digit 1.Assume NO other operations are available.Decimal points are not allowed(eg 1.1 or 11.1), nor is implicit use of base 10 by concatenating digits(eg 11 or 111).<h3 align="center">Input</h3><p>First line contains the number of test cases T &le 1000.Then follow the tests each containing a single integer N , 1 &le N &le 1000.<h3 align="center">Output</h3><p>For each test print the minimum possible 1s using which it is possible to make N ,following the rules mentioned above.<h3 align="center">Example</h3><pre><b>Input:</b>523689<b>Output:</b>23323</pre>
