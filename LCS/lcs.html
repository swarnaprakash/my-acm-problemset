<h3>Problem Name : LCS</h3>
<h3>Time Limit : 20s </h3>

<p>
A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
For example, "AGH" is a subsequence of "ABCDEFGH" while "AHG" is not.
<p>
Longest common subsequence(LCS) of two strings is a common subsequence of maximal length.Given two strings your task is to find the length of the LCS.

<h3>Input:</h3>
<p>
Number of testcases t &le 100 on the first line.Each test contains two strings in separate lines.The strings will contain ONLY uppercase alphabets.Length of the strings &le 12000.

<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>
Output one line per test containing the length of the LCS.
