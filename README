My problems for ACM style programming contests. Most of them were written during my UG.
Following are the list of contests that I have conducted and/or contributed in the past.
Contribution includes creating problems, generating test data that is used to judge 
contestant's solution during the contest and writing alternative solutions to colleague's problems.
Some of the problems were used for offline contests.
