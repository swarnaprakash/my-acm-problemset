<h3>Problem Name	:	Recurring Decimals</h3>
<h3>Time	Limit		:	2s</h3>

<p>
A recurring decimal (or repeating decimal) is a rational number whose expression in the decimal numeral system has some point after which the same sequence of digits repeats infinitely-many times. The repetition may begin before, at, or after the decimal point and the repeating sequence may consist of just one digit or of any finite number of digits.For instance 1/3 = 0.3333333… (spoken as "0.3 repeating").
<p>
Given a fraction not necessarily in simplified form,write a program to find if its a recurring decimal of not.

<h3>Input:</h3>
<p>
Number of tests t given in the first line (t &le 200). Then lines follow each containing the fraction p/q where 1 &le p,q &le 2^31-1.

<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>
One line per test.print "NONTERMINATING" if its a recurring decimal or else print "TERMINATING"

<h3>Sample input:</h3>
<pre>
5
2/3
5/10
4/9
1/6
1/5
</pre>
<h3>Sample output:</h3>
<pre>
NONTERMINATING
TERMINATING
NONTERMINATING
NONTERMINATING
TERMINATING
