<h3>Problem Name: SCS</h3>
<h3>Time Limit : 2s</h3>

<p>
A supersequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by inserting some of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the original characters.For example "ABCDEFGH" is a supersequence of "AGH",but is not a supersequence of "AHG".
<p>
The shortest common supersequence of two strings (SCS) is a common supersequence of minimal length.
For two input strings, an SCS can be formed from an LCS(longest Common subsequence) easily.By inserting the non-LCS symbols from both strings into LCS ,while preserving the symbol order, we get the SCS.
<p>
Given two strings your task is to find the length of the SCS.

<h3>Input:</h3>
<p>
Number of testcases t &le 100 on the first line.Each test contains two strings in separate lines.The strings will contain ONLY uppercase alphabets.Length of the strings &le 100.

<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>
Output one line per test containing the length of the SCS.

<h3>Sample Input:</h3>
<pre>
3
ABC
BAC
AGH
ABCDEFGH

ABCDEFGH
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output:</h3>
