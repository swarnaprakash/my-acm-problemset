<p><h3>Problem Name	:	Bottom coder Challenge Phase</h3><p>
<p><h3>Time Limit		:	1s</h3><p>

<p>

In Bottom coder competitions after coding phase, there is a challenge phase.During the Challenge Phase, you have the opportunity to view the source code submissions of the other competitors in your competition room. If you believe that any of the submissions are flawed, you may challenge the submission with a specific test case that you feel will result in that submission returning the wrong result. If your challenge is successful, and the submission returns the wrong result, you will be awarded 50 points and the competitor will lose the points that were received for the challenged submission. However, if your challenge is unsuccessful, and the submission returns the correct result for the test case, you will lose 25 points from your score.
<p>
	Vijay is viewing his competition statistics.Almost all of the challenges made by vijay have failed.He wants to analyse his challenge stratergies.Total number of challenges made by vijay & total points gained during the challenge phase is available(it may be negative).You have to help vijay by writing a program to find the number of sucessful challenges made by vijay in each competition.Also some of the statistics have been corrupted and represent data that doesn't make sense.
<p>
Data is invalid,if there is no 'meaningful' number of sucessful challenges and unsucessful challenges,that yield the given points in the input.
	
<p><h3>
Input:</h3><p>
First line contains the number of test cases t.Then t lines follow each containing two space separated integers 0 &le q &le 20 and abs(g) &le 1000, where q is the total number of challenges made in that match and g is the points gained during challenge phase.
<p><h3>
Output:</h3><p>
Output one per test containing the integer representing the number of sucessful challenges or "INVALID DATA" if the data doesn't make sense.
