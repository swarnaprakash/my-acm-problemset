Once upon a time in china , there lived Wu yangwi.He had two children Bu yangwi and Yu yangwi.Bu yangwi had one child Su yangwi who had no child, while Yu yangwi had two children Hu yangwi & Ju yangwi , Hu yangwi had ..........(this goes on).This is too confusing and we want to know how many generations they existed ,given information about  yangwi family. you have to write a program to find that.

<p>
The tree will be represented in the following specification.
<br>
A specification will be sequence of digits(without spaces).
<br>
The first digit in the specification tells the number of children of the first yangwi ancestor.
<br>
Then follows the specification of the first child. 
<br>
Then follows the specification of the next child and so on ...

<p>
And government of china had imposed a strict rule restricting the number of children , one can have , to TWO.
<p>
<h3>
INPUT:</h3><p>

First line contains the number of test cases.Each test consists of a string of charaters (without spaces) representing the specification(it will contain either '0' or '1' or '2').length of the string will be less than 100.
<p><h3>
OUTPUT:</h3><p>
For each test print an integer in a separate line,the number of generations for which the family existed.
