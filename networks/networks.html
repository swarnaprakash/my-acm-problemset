<h3>Problem Name : Computer Networks</h3>
<h3>Time Limit : 4s</h3>

<p>
Bytelandian Scientists have built a new computer network.Any connection in the network is bidirectional.After building the network scientists are concerned about establishing communication between some computers.Communication can be established between two computers if there is a communication path between the two computers.For instance if there is a connection between C1 and C2 ,and a connection between C2 and C3 ,then C1 can establish communication with C3.

<p>
Given a set of connections in the network you have to find if we can establish communication between some computers.

<h3>Input:</h3>
<p>
Each test begins with two integers N &le 100 and M &le N*(N-1)/2 , representing the number of computers in the network and number of connections.Then follow M connections containing two space separated integers a and b , 1 &le a,b &le N .This means there is a bidirectional connection between a and b.Then follows an integer Q &le 5000 representing the number of querries.Then follows Q lines containing two integers p,q 1 &le p,q &le N ,asking if communication can be established between the computers p and q. N=M=0 indicates the end of tests.A blank line will separate the tests.

<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>
Output Q lines for each test case containing the word "YES" if a connection can be established else "NO".Print a blank line after each test case.
