<h3>Problem Name	:	Recurring Decimals Again</h3>
<h3>Time	Limit		:	2s</h3>

<p>
A recurring decimal (or repeating decimal) is a rational number whose expression in the decimal numeral system has some point after which the same sequence of digits repeats infinitely-many times. The repetition may begin before, at, or after the decimal point and the repeating sequence may consist of just one digit or of any finite number of digits. For instance 1/3 = 0.3333333… (spoken as "0.3 repeating").

<p>
Given a non-terminating recurring decimal your task is to convert them into fraction.
<p>
All decimals given are less than one.
<h3>Input:</h3>
<p>
Number of tests(&le 200) is given in the first line.For each test case there is one line of input of the form "0.dddd..." where dddd is a string of 1 to 9 digits.The length of the string "dddd" represents the period of the sequence of digits that repeat.For instance if the input is 0.23 then the decimal is 0.23232323.....

<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>
Output one per test the fraction in the form p/q where p,q >= 1 and p and q have no common factors.

<h3>Sample Input:</h3>
<pre>
3
0.3...
0.60...
0.6...
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output:</h3>
<pre>
1/3
20/33
2/3
</pre>

<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>
The three dots after each test is part of the input and not typo.
